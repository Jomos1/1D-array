Questions

You must give a short explanation for each answer.

1) Create a reference to an array of integers named "cat".

Answer:

2) What is the output of the following code fragment?

var cat = [2, 4, 6, 8];

console.log(cat[0] + " " + cat[1]);

Answer:"2 4" It's "2 4" because the console log isn't adding the two numbers in the array together, but is putting a space or " " between the two values so as not to add them but put them next to each other, like in a sentence.

3) What is the output of the following code fragment?

var y = [ , , , , , , , , , ];

y[0] = 34;
y[1] = 88;

console.log(y[0] + " " + y[1] + " " + y[5]);

Answer: "34 88 undefined" The reason for this is because the function is not adding the two numbers, but is just putting them next to each other by putting a " " in between them, and the reason there is an undefined is because the value "y[5]" does not have a number assigned to it.

4) What is the output of the following code fragment?

var zip = [7, 3, 4, 1, 9];

console.log(zip[2+1]);

Answer: "1" The reason it's this and not 7 is because this function isn't adding the two values, but instead is, for a lack of a better word, counting. So the console.log is using "zip[2]" and since counting an array starts from 0 the number it's calling out is 4, but since it's "zip[2+1]" what it's really saying is "zip[3]" and in the array "3" is the value 1, that's why the output is 1. 


5) What is the output of the following code fragment?

var x = [7, 3, 4, , , , , , ];

console.log((x[0] + x[1]) + " " + x[5]);

Answer:"10 undefined" The reason for this output is, the console.log is adding the values of x[0] and x[1], and since theres a space between the prior and x[5], the sum of those two are not being added with x[5]. and since theres not assigned value for x[5], then it's undefined.
